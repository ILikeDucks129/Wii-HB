<long_description>AnyTitle Deleter is an application coded by tona to delete any title from your Wii, even those impossible to delete "normally".
This version is a "mod" by Red Squirrel of the original one: now the real name (and not only the title ID as in the original version!) of (almost) any title will appear near it in the menu!
In this way you can understand simply and immediately what you're removing!
